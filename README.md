## The Project
Connect4 is based on the classic board game of the same title. This project is a simple version of the game that can be played between two players in the terminal of a singular machine. Future iterations of this project will likely include a bot that can play the game against a user with the possiblity of increasing the difficulty of the bot untill it reaches the [perfect connect four startegy](http://web.mit.edu/sp.268/www/2010/connectFourSlides.pdf) as the highest difficulty.
